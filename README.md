# Starknet Contract State Verifier ⚡️⚡

## Overview

The Starknet Contract State Verifier is a comprehensive suite designed to enhance transparency and security in smart contract development on the Starknet ecosystem. This toolset allows developers, auditors, and researchers to fetch, compare, and analyze the state of Starknet contracts at specific block numbers, providing historical state tracking, event log analysis, and advanced security audits.

## Features

- **Contract State Fetching**: Retrieve the state of Starknet contracts at specified block numbers.
- **State Comparison Engine**: Compare fetched states with expected states, supporting deep comparison of complex data structures.
- **Block Explorer Interface**: Python interface for interacting with Starknet block explorers and node APIs.
- **Smart Contract Decoder**: Decode smart contract ABIs into human-readable formats.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate comprehensive reports and visualizations of contract states.
- **Automated Testing Suite**: Ensure the tool's accuracy and integrity.
- **Security Audit Tool**: Analyze contracts for common vulnerabilities and integrity checks.

## Modules

1. **State Fetcher (`state_fetcher.cairo`)**: Interacts with Starknet to fetch contract states.
2. **State Comparison (`state_comparison.cairo`)**: Compares fetched and expected states.
3. **Block Explorer Interface (`block_explorer_interface.py`)**: Fetches additional data like transaction history.
4. **Contract Decoder (`contract_decoder.py`)**: Decodes ABIs for state interpretation.
5. **Data Visualization (`data_visualization.py`)**: Visualizes and reports state data.
6. **Test Suite (`automated_test_suite.py`)**: Conducts tests for verifier accuracy.
7. **Security Auditor (`security_audit_tool.py`)**: Performs security analysis of contracts.
